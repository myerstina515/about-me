### Reflections and Comments

<!-- * Consider including the answers to your daily journal and submission questions here
* This is also a good place to reflect on the tools and resources used and learned -->

* While single quotes may be the standard for JS, when you need to use an apostrophe in a string, you have to use double quotes to set off your string. [I’ve since learned about escaping the apostrophe with a backslash (e.g., Nathan\’s), but I find that approach rather unsightly. Duckett says you can just use double quotes, but CF says you can’t.]

* Inline styling is confusing and prone to human error. I can see how the concept of "separation of concerns" came about.

* I was proud that I figured out, roughly, how to generate an even number randomly.
